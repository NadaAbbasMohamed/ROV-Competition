# ROV-Competition
Here I added the computer vision subteam tasks and projects required for the ROV Competition. I participated in this competition as a team member in Arrow Racing team in collage time.

## Task 1: Color Detection Task - Detect Change in the color of colar reefs
## (artificially made using a number of colored pipes):-
This is an implementation of Color Detection change for hand made coral reef using number of colored pips. This implementation was for a competition challenge. It was implemented using Python and Opencv. The target of this task was to detect the change of color in corals image captured by the camera based original coral photo to the.

## Task 2: Images Concatenation Task
a maket of bus made up of plastic sheets of different colors was used for this task. the requirement was to capture live images of this maket then concatenate the images of each side together to have full view of the box aka. Bus

## Task 3 - Object Dimensions Detection: 
It was required to detect the dimensions of square like objects representing underwater polutants. the objects were blue colored
