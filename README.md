# ROV-Competition
Here I added the computer vision subteam tasks and projects required for the ROV Competition. I participated in this competition as a team member in Arrow Racing team in collage time.

## Task 2: Images Concatenation Task
a maket of bus made up of plastic sheets of different colors was used for this task. the requirement was to capture live images of this maket then concatenate the images of each side together to have full view of the box aka. Bus
